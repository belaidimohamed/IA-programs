This repo is mostly made for learning and experiments purposes .

Here you can find :

--------------------------------  OpenCV  --------------------------------------

* gesture detection : controlling mouse using two fingers in front of the camera
* object detection : train with a set of object images to recognize it later
* color detection 
* words nltk 
* face detection , recognition (training with dataset)
* voice recognition (speech_recognition lib)

--------------------------------  Pytorch  ----------------------------------------

* practical and theoretical application of different neural networks (NN , CNN , RNN ..)
* Trying those neural networks on real dataset downloaded from the internet
* exploring differnet loss functions ( smoothingLabel .. )
* simple downloader (see "face-mask" repo to see the enhaced version)
